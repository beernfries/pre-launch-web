# 🚀 Beer n Fries pre-launch website

Splash screen to use as primary website pre-launch. Built with plain _HTML_ and _CSS_ (_SCSS_) hosted using _GitHub Pages_.

__⚠️ This is a temporary site used before the real site is live.__

## Getting started

__Install dependencies.__

```bash
npm install
```

__Build__

Compile the _SCSS_ in this project into _CSS_ by running the following command.

```bash
npm run sasss
```

## Hosting

The website contains static files only and is hosted using _GitHub Pages_. The folder `/docs` on branch `main` contains the hosted website. __Make sure the site is working correctly before commiting to `main`__.

> __Important:__ Remember to build the _SCSS_ before commiting to `main` because there is no build server.

## SCSS Framework

The _SCSS_ is based on [alexerlandsson/scss-boilerplate](https://github.com/alexerlandsson/scss-boilerplate). See the `README` in that repoistory for structure and guidelines.
